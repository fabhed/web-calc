The architecture for a calculator website will consist of several components. We will use Python with Flask for the backend, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application and routes for our website.

2. `calculator.py`: This file will contain the Calculator class with methods for different operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. `templates/index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will contain the frontend of our calculator.

4. `static/styles.css`: This file will contain all the CSS styles for our calculator.

5. `static/main.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code to handle user interactions with the calculator.

6. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our application needs.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`app.py`
